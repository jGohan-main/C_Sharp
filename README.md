# C#

C# is a modern, versatile, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft as part of its .NET initiative. As an object-oriented programming (OOP) language, C# is structured around classes and objects, which allow developers to create modular, reusable, and maintainable code.

# Key Principles of OOP in C#

### 1. **Classes and Objects**
- **Class**: A blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and methods (functions) that the objects instantiated from the class will have.
- **Object**: An instance of a class, representing a real-world entity with a defined state (properties) and behavior (methods). Multiple objects can be created from the same class.
